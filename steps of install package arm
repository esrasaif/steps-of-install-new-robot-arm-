in this file I wrote specific steps that install the arm package on ros which will operate on RViz program **hint**>> you can find the fully steps of  install ros on ubunto and install the arm package in one file in another repository on my acoount under the tittle"steps of install ros on ubuntu " 

 1 - now we will install catkin which from it we can make workspace ,*hint* here i named the workspace by catkin_ws but you can name it anythig else if you want
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-catkin
    then we will craet file inside it 
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
     then
      cd ~/catkin_ws/
     then we will install inside file src all the packages that related to arm
      catkin_make
      then 
      cd ~/catkin_ws/src
     then 
      git clone https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm.git 
      then
      cd ~/catkin_ws
    then to install some packages from ros 
      rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    then
     sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-moveit
   then
     sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joint-state-publisher ros-kinetic-joint-state-publisher-gui
   then
    sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control joint-state-publisher
   then
     sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-controllers ros-kinetic-ros-control
 2-now we have to put the source file of setup.bash inside bashrc so continue to put the below commands
     sudo nano ~/.bashrc
      after write this command you have to move to the last commands that appear on the terminal screen to write the next command, you have to write the name of your machine that will appear in the next line to know yhat go to the files >home>catkin_ws >devel> click right on the file "setup.bash" >properties> then at paren folder you will find thelink of the filewith your own name machine so then you can copy it and adding at the beginning the word "sourc" and at the end " /setup.bash "  , as i wrote in the next line  
    source /home/esra/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash     
   then 
    ctrl + o
   then
    pree enter 
   then
     ctrl + x
    then 
     source ~/.bashrc
     
 3-finally write last command below to operate the program RVis
       roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors.launch
